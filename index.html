        <p>I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my journey about learning to code, understand the concepts to the depths, apply that knowledge and build useful tools to make our lives easy.</p>
<p>As I'm typing, the chain of my thoughts to express here seems as complicated to track, as it seems to apply my existing knowledge of programming anywhere, to my little mind right now.</p>
<p>So, being in my first year, I felt being unequipped and digressed from the path while learning any new language. This happened because of the vast terminologies, big buzzwords and deep concepts which you cannot understand and just accept. This is because every time you are fed with some new information you tend to ask "why?", well at least in my case, that entangles you into a-never-ending-chain of "why?"s .This information chain that is very deep, new, and tedious to you, creates so much of frustration that you might find learning these computer skills would be the last things you want to learn.</p>
<p>As much as this is true, with the current advancements all over it is necessary to acquire the expertise in computing. As for my case, just a lack of direction can't stop me from learning what I want to. I have attended various seminars, spoken to many seniors, actively took part in developer circle group discussions, then advanced to doing online courses.</p>
<p>Currently I have elementary knowledge about C, C++, python, JAVA, html(evidently) and data structures. I'm signing off my first blog and I will keep you posted as I forge ahead in my voyage!</p>
<p>à bientôt</p>
